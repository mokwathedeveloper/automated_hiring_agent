### Problem Description
The project was missing `postcss.config.js`, which is essential for Next.js to correctly process Tailwind CSS. This resulted in Tailwind styles not being applied, leading to a plain white UI in the web browser.

### Root Cause
The `postcss.config.js` file was not present in the project root directory.

### Solution
Created `postcss.config.js` with the standard PostCSS configuration, including `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` plugins, to enable proper processing of Tailwind CSS.
