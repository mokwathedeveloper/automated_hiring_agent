# Feature: ResumeUploader Component

## Problem Description
The application needed a user-friendly resume upload component that supports both drag-and-drop and traditional file selection. Users required immediate feedback during file processing and clear validation for supported file types and sizes.

## Root Cause Analysis
The existing codebase lacked:
- Dedicated resume upload component with modern UX patterns
- Drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive file handling
- Client-side file validation before processing
- Integration with the text extraction utility
- Visual feedback during file processing states

## Applied Solution
Created comprehensive ResumeUploader component with:

### Core Features
```typescript
export default function ResumeUploader() {
  const [isDragging, setIsDragging] = useState(false);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  // ... implementation
}
```

### Key Functionality
- **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Full drag-over, drag-leave, and drop event handling
- **File Browser Fallback**: Hidden file input with click-to-browse functionality
- **File Validation**: PDF/DOCX type checking and 5MB size limit enforcement
- **Text Extraction Integration**: Direct integration with `extractTextFromFile` utility
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during file processing with spinner animation

### UI/UX Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with Tailwind CSS
- **Visual Feedback**: Dynamic styling for drag-over states and loading indicators
- **Clear Instructions**: User guidance for supported formats and file size limits
- **Error Handling**: Alert-based feedback for validation failures and processing errors

### Performance Optimizations
- **useCallback Hooks**: Optimized event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Ref Management**: Direct DOM access for file input without state updates
- **Efficient Validation**: Client-side checks before expensive text extraction
