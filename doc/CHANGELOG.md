## [2025-09-09] - Audit Fixes and Dashboard Enhancements

### Added

#### feat(db): create candidates view
**Commit**: (will be added after commit)
**Date**: 2025-09-09
**Description**: To align with the project blueprint, a `candidates` view was added to the database. This view joins the `users`, `profiles`, and `resumes` tables to provide a unified representation of candidate data without altering the underlying schema.

### Fixed

#### fix(dashboard): connect to live data
**Commit**: (will be added after commit)
**Date**: 2025-09-09
**Description**: The dashboard was refactored to fetch live data from a new `/api/resumes` endpoint, replacing all static mock data. Loading and error states were also added for a better user experience.

### Refactored

#### refactor(dashboard): implement shadcn/ui cards
**Commit**: (will be added after commit)
**Date**: 2025-09-09
**Description**: The dashboard UI was significantly improved by replacing the basic list of resumes with a responsive grid of `shadcn/ui` `Card` components. Each card provides a structured and detailed view of the candidate's analysis results.
