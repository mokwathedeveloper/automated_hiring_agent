### Fix: WhatsApp Test Failures

**Issue:** Tests in `whatsapp.test.tsx` were failing with `Unable to find a label with the text of: /phone number/i`.

**Analysis:** The issue was identified as a timing problem where the test was attempting to query for the phone number input field before the dialog, which contains the input, had fully rendered after a click event.

**Attempted Resolution:**
1.  Wrapped the `fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Send Resume'));` and subsequent queries for the phone input within `await act` blocks.
2.  Introduced `await waitFor(() => { expect(screen.getByLabelText(/phone number/i)).toBeInTheDocument(); });` to explicitly wait for the phone number input to be present in the DOM before proceeding with interactions.

**Current Status:** The issue persists, indicating that the asynchronous nature of the dialog rendering or other factors might still be at play. Further investigation is needed.

**Files Modified:**
-   `__tests__/whatsapp.test.tsx`
