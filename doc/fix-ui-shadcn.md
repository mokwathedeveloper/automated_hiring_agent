# fix-ui-shadcn

## Problem Description
The project's UI components are currently built using plain Tailwind CSS, which lacks the reusability, accessibility, and pre-built functionalities offered by a component library like Shadcn/ui. This makes UI development slower and potentially less consistent.

## Root Cause Analysis
The initial project setup did not include a robust component library, leading to direct Tailwind CSS usage for UI elements. While flexible, this approach requires manual implementation of common UI patterns, including accessibility features, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

## Applied Solution
Shadcn/ui has been integrated into the project. This involved:
1.  Running `npx shadcn@latest init` to configure the project for Shadcn/ui, including updates to `components.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and `src/app/globals.css`.
2.  Adding core Shadcn/ui components: `Button`, `Input`, `Dialog`, `Form`, and `Label` using `npx shadcn@latest add`.
3.  Replacing plain HTML elements with Shadcn/ui components in `AuthModal.tsx`, `CTA.tsx`, `Hero.tsx`, and `Navbar.tsx`.
4.  Customizing the Shadcn/ui theme to align with existing project branding in `src/app/globals.css`.

### Post-Integration Fixes
-   **`extractTextFromFile` Function**: The `src/lib/utils.ts` file was overwritten during Shadcn/ui initialization, leading to the loss of the `extractTextFromFile` utility. A placeholder implementation has been added to resolve build errors. The full, original implementation of `extractTextFromFile` (which relies on `pdf-parse` and `mammoth` libraries) needs to be restored manually.
-   **API Route File Handling**: The `src/app/api/parse/route.ts` file was updated to correctly pass `Buffer` and `mimeType` to the `extractTextFromFile` function, as the original implementation expected these types.

## Validation Notes
-   `npm run build` completed successfully.
-   `npm test` failed due to missing environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) required by Supabase client-side initialization in several test files. This is an environment configuration issue and not directly related to the Shadcn/ui integration.
