# fix-ui-shadcn

## Problem Description
The project's UI components are currently built using plain Tailwind CSS, which lacks the reusability, accessibility, and pre-built functionalities offered by a component library like Shadcn/ui. This makes UI development slower and potentially less consistent.

## Root Cause Analysis
The initial project setup did not include a robust component library, leading to direct Tailwind CSS usage for UI elements. While flexible, this approach requires manual implementation of common UI patterns, including accessibility features, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

## Applied Solution
Shadcn/ui has been integrated into the project. This involved:
1.  Running `npx shadcn@latest init` to configure the project for Shadcn/ui, including updates to `components.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and `src/app/globals.css`.
2.  Adding core Shadcn/ui components: `Button`, `Input`, `Dialog`, `Form`, and `Label` using `npx shadcn@latest add`. These components provide pre-built, accessible, and customizable UI elements that will replace existing plain Tailwind implementations.
