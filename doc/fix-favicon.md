# Fix: Missing favicon.ico

## Problem Description
The Next.js application was missing the `public/favicon.ico` file, which is expected by browsers and Next.js for the site icon.

## Root Cause Analysis
Next.js applications automatically serve static files from the `public/` directory. The absence of `favicon.ico` would result in 404 errors when browsers request the site icon and could cause console warnings.

## Solution Applied
- Created `public/` directory
- Downloaded and added a standard favicon.ico file from Next.js official site
- The favicon is now accessible at `/favicon.ico` route
