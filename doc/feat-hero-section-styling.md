### Problem Description
The Hero section's color scheme was not fully aligned with the new custom palette, and its responsiveness could be further refined to ensure a consistent and polished look across various screen sizes.

### Root Cause
Existing color classes in `Hero.tsx` were not updated to use the new custom palette defined in `tailwind.config.ts`.

### Solution
Updated color classes in `Hero.tsx` to use the new `primary` and `gray` palette, and reviewed responsive classes for optimal display on different screen sizes, enhancing the overall visual appeal and consistency.
