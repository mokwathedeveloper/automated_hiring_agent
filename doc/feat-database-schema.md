# Feature: Database Schema

## Problem Description
The application required a comprehensive database schema to support user authentication, resume storage, payment tracking, and WhatsApp bot sessions. Without proper database structure, the application could not persist user data or maintain subscription states.

## Root Cause Analysis
The existing codebase lacked:
- User profile and subscription management tables
- Resume storage with analysis results
- Payment tracking for Paystack integration
- WhatsApp session state management
- Row Level Security policies for data protection

## Applied Solution
Created comprehensive database schema in `database/schema.sql` with:

### Tables Created
- `users` - User profiles with subscription tiers and limits
- `resumes` - Resume storage with analysis results
- `analyses` - Detailed analysis breakdowns
- `subscriptions` - Paystack payment tracking
- `whatsapp_sessions` - Bot conversation state

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- User-specific data access policies
- Automatic timestamp triggers
- UUID primary keys with proper references
