# Feature: Magic Link Authentication

## Problem Description
The application needed passwordless authentication to provide a seamless user experience. Traditional password-based authentication creates friction and security concerns for users accessing resume analysis services.

## Root Cause Analysis
The existing codebase lacked:
- User authentication system
- Secure login mechanism
- Session management
- Protected routes for authenticated users

## Applied Solution
Implemented magic link authentication using Supabase Auth:

### Components Created
- `AuthForm` - Email input with magic link sending
- Auth callback route - Handles magic link verification
- Authentication page - Clean UI for login process

### Features Implemented
- Passwordless email-based authentication
- Automatic redirect to dashboard after login
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Integration with Supabase auth system
