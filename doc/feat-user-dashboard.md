# Feature: User Dashboard

## Problem Description
Authenticated users needed a centralized dashboard to view their resume analysis history, track usage statistics, and manage their account. Without a dashboard, users had no way to access their previous analyses or monitor their subscription status.

### Dashboard Features
- Resume analysis history with scores
- Usage statistics and limits
- User profile information
- Sign-out functionality

- Resume history list with visual score indicators
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Loading states and error handling
