# Feature: Store Parsed Resumes

## Problem Description
The application needed to persist resume analysis results in the database so users could access their analysis history and track improvements over time. Without storage, each analysis was lost after the session ended.

## Root Cause Analysis
The existing codebase lacked:
- Database integration in parse API
- Resume storage functionality
- User-specific data persistence
- Analysis history retrieval

## Applied Solution
Enhanced parse API and created resumes endpoint:

### Storage Implementation
- Modified `/api/parse` to store analysis results
- Created `/api/resumes` endpoint for data retrieval
- Integrated with Supabase database
- Added authentication checks for data security

### Features Added
- Automatic storage of successful analyses
- User-specific resume history
- Error handling without breaking API flow
- Resume metadata tracking (filename, file type, timestamps)
