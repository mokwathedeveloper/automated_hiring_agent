# Parse API - Prompt Engineering Implementation

## Problem Description
The application needed a dedicated API endpoint for individual resume analysis with professional-grade prompt engineering to ensure consistent, high-quality AI assessments.

## Root Cause Analysis
- No dedicated parse endpoint for individual resume analysis
- Lack of structured prompting for consistent AI responses
- Missing role-based prompting for professional HR assessments
- No template management for prompt consistency

## Applied Solution
Implemented robust prompt engineering with:

### Professional Role-Based Prompting
```typescript
const PROMPT_TEMPLATES = {
  RESUME_ANALYSIS: `You are an expert HR professional and resume analyst. Analyze the provided resume against the job description with precision and objectivity.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Provide a numerical score from 1-100 based on job fit
- Write a concise 2-3 sentence summary
- List 3-5 specific strengths (pros) with evidence from the resume
- List 2-4 areas for improvement (cons) or missing qualifications
- Focus on skills, experience, and qualifications relevant to the job
- Be objective and constructive in your assessment

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON only):
{
  "score": <number 1-100>,
  "summary": "<brief assessment>",
  "pros": ["<specific strength 1>", "<specific strength 2>", ...],
  "cons": ["<area for improvement 1>", "<missing qualification 1>", ...]
}`,
} as const;
```

### Key Features
