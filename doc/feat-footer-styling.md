### Problem Description
The Footer's color scheme was not fully aligned with the new custom palette, lacking consistency with the overall design and professional appearance.

### Root Cause
Existing color classes in `Footer.tsx` were not updated to use the new custom palette defined in `tailwind.config.ts`.

### Solution
Applied the new custom color scheme (`gray` and `primary` gradients) to the Footer for a consistent and professional look, aligning it with the rest of the UI.
