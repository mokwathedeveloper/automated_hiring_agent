# Fix: WhatsApp Component Accessibility

## Problem
The WhatsApp component's phone number input field was not properly associated with its label, causing accessibility issues and test failures.

## Root Cause
The `<label>` element was missing the `htmlFor` attribute, and the `<input>` element was missing the corresponding `id` attribute, breaking the semantic relationship between them.

## Solution
Added proper label-input association:

```tsx
// Before
<label className="block text-sm font-medium text-green-700 mb-1">
  Phone Number (with country code)
</label>
<input
  type="tel"
  // ... other props
/>

// After
<label htmlFor="phone-input" className="block text-sm font-medium text-green-700 mb-1">
  Phone Number (with country code)
</label>
<input
  id="phone-input"
  type="tel"
  // ... other props
/>
```

## Impact
- ✅ Improved accessibility for screen readers
- ✅ Fixed failing unit tests
- ✅ Better semantic HTML structure
- ✅ Enhanced user experience for assistive technologies
