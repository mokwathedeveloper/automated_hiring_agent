# Authentication Implementation Fix

## Problem Description
The application needed a complete authentication system to secure API routes and provide user-specific features like WhatsApp integration and premium subscriptions.

## Root Cause
- No authentication system was implemented
- API routes were unprotected
- User session management was missing
- No login/signup functionality

## Solution Implemented

### 1. NextAuth.js Integration
- Added NextAuth.js with credentials provider
- Created authentication configuration in `src/lib/nextauth.ts`
- Implemented API route at `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`

### 2. Authentication Components
- Created `AuthModal.tsx` for login/signup forms
- Updated `Navbar.tsx` with session-aware UI
- Added `ClientSessionProvider.tsx` for client-side session management

### 3. Session Management
- Integrated session provider in layout
- Added authentication checks to API routes
- Implemented logout functionality

### 4. Security Features
- Password hashing with bcryptjs
- JWT session strategy
- Protected API endpoints
