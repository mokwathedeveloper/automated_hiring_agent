### Problem Description
The UI lacked a consistent and professional color scheme, relying on default Tailwind colors or ad-hoc definitions, which made it difficult to maintain a cohesive visual design.

### Root Cause
No explicit custom color palette was defined in `tailwind.config.ts`.

### Solution
Defined a custom color palette (`primary`, `secondary`, `gray`) in `tailwind.config.ts` to ensure consistent and professional UI styling across the application.
