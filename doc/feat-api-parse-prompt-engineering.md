# API Parse - Robust Prompt Engineering Implementation

## Feature Description
Enhanced the OpenAI prompt template with comprehensive context, structured evaluation framework, and professional HR expertise to ensure consistent, high-quality resume analysis results.

## Design Rationale
- **Consistency**: Structured prompts reduce variability in AI responses across different resume evaluations
- **Professional Context**: Senior HR professional persona (15+ years experience) provides authoritative evaluation perspective
- **Objective Framework**: Clear scoring criteria and bands ensure fair, standardized candidate assessment
- **Evidence-Based**: Requirements for specific evidence from resumes prevent hallucinated assessments
- **Actionable Feedback**: Constructive tone and improvement areas help candidates understand evaluation

## Applied Solution

### Enhanced Professional Context
```typescript
const PROMPT_TEMPLATES = {
  RESUME_ANALYSIS: `You are a senior HR professional with 15+ years of experience in talent acquisition and resume evaluation. Your expertise spans multiple industries and you excel at objective candidate assessment.

CONTEXT & ROLE:
- Evaluate candidates with fairness and precision
- Focus on job-relevant qualifications and transferable skills
- Consider both technical competencies and cultural fit indicators
- Provide actionable feedback for candidate improvement`
```

### Structured Evaluation Framework
```typescript
ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
1. RELEVANCE SCORING (40%): Direct job requirement alignment
2. EXPERIENCE QUALITY (30%): Depth, progression, and achievements
3. SKILLS MATCH (20%): Technical and soft skills compatibility
4. POTENTIAL INDICATORS (10%): Growth trajectory and adaptability
```

### Clear Scoring Bands
```typescript
EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Score 90-100: Exceptional fit, exceeds most requirements
- Score 75-89: Strong candidate, meets key requirements with minor gaps
- Score 60-74: Good potential, some important requirements missing
- Score 45-59: Moderate fit, significant skill/experience gaps
- Score 1-44: Poor match, major misalignment with role requirements
```
