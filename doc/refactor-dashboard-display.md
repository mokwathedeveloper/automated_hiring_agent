### Problem

The initial display of resume analysis results in the dashboard was a simple grid of cards, which lacked responsiveness for different screen sizes and did not fully leverage the capabilities of Shadcn/ui components for a professional and accessible user experience. Specifically, there was no dedicated table view for desktop users, and accessibility features were not explicitly implemented.

### Root Cause

The dashboard's UI was developed with a primary focus on displaying individual resume summaries. As the scope expanded to include a comprehensive candidate management system, the display needed to evolve to handle larger datasets efficiently and provide a more structured and accessible presentation across various devices.

### Solution Implemented

The candidate display in `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` has been significantly enhanced to provide a responsive and accessible user experience, utilizing Shadcn/ui components:

- **Responsive Layout:**
    - **Mobile:** Candidates are displayed as stacked cards (`grid grid-cols-1`).
    - **Tablet:** Candidates are displayed in a two-column grid (`md:grid-cols-2`).
    - **Desktop:** A dedicated table view is implemented using Shadcn/ui `Table` components (`hidden lg:block`). This provides a structured and efficient way to view multiple candidate details.
- **Shadcn/ui Integration:** All relevant UI elements, including `Card`, `Table`, `Input`, and `Badge`, now consistently use Shadcn/ui components, ensuring a cohesive design and leveraging their built-in accessibility features.
- **Accessibility (Implicit):** By using Shadcn/ui components, which are built with accessibility in mind (e.g., proper ARIA roles, keyboard navigation), the dashboard's accessibility has been implicitly improved. Further explicit ARIA attributes can be added as needed for specific custom interactions.
