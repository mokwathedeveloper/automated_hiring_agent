# 🏆 PLP Nigeria Hackathon Demo - Payment Integration Notes

## **💳 Payment System Status**

### **Current Implementation: Paystack (Kenya Account)**
- **Account Location**: Kenya 🇰🇪
- **Supported Currency**: KES (Kenyan Shilling)
- **Target Market**: Nigeria 🇳🇬 (NGN - Nigerian Naira)

### **🚨 Known Limitation for Demo**

**Issue**: Currency Mismatch
- Our Paystack account is registered in Kenya (KES only)
- Target users are in Nigeria (expecting NGN pricing)
- Paystack doesn't support cross-currency transactions

**Demo Solution**: 
- Use KES pricing with equivalent values
- Display clear currency conversion information
- Document as "Demo Mode" limitation

### **💰 Pricing Conversion (NGN → KES)**

| Plan | Nigeria (NGN) | Kenya Demo (KES) | Conversion Rate |
|------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Starter | ₦5,000 | KSh 1,250 | ~1:0.25 |
| Professional | ₦15,000 | KSh 3,750 | ~1:0.25 |
| Enterprise | ₦50,000 | KSh 12,500 | ~1:0.25 |
